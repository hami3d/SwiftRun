- **🚀 Silky Smooth UI**: Everything is hardware accelerated. From the high-FPS entry animations to the sub-pixel font rendering.
- **⚡ Built with Rust**: Blazing fast, memory-safe, and incredibly lightweight. It’s there when you need it and invisible when you don’t.

## 🚀 Getting Started

SwiftRun is portable and easy to set up.

### 💾 Installation
Run SwiftRun from your terminal with the install flag:
```powershell
.\swift_run.exe --install
```
This will set up the necessary registry hooks to autostart with Windows and bind the `Win+R` key to SwiftRun.

### 🗑️ Uninstallation
If you ever want to go back to the standard dialog:
```powershell
.\swift_run.exe --uninstall
```
It cleans up after itself perfectly, restoring the default Windows behavior.
