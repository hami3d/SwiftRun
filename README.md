## 🚀 Getting Started

SwiftRun is portable and easy to set up.

### 💾 Installation
Run the installation file and You are Good to Go:
```powershell
.\swift_run_Install.exe
```
This will set up the necessary registry hooks to autostart with Windows and bind the `Win+R` key to SwiftRun.

### 🗑️ Uninstallation
If you want to go revert to the old Run dialog, Run the Uninstall Version:
```powershell
.\swift_run_Uninstall.exe
```
It cleans up after itself perfectly, restoring the default Windows behavior.
